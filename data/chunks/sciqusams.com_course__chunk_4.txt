What Are Automated Playbooks in AMS? An Automated Playbook is a pre-built, rule-based sequence of actions triggered by specific customer behaviors, milestones, or risks. Instead of relying on manual tracking and follow-ups, the AMS detects events in real time and automatically executes your next best action.
