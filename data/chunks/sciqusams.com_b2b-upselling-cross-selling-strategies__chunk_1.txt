Practices for Upselling for Account Managers Account managers are more than just support; they are drivers of growth. They should utilize these best practices when upselling to find the hidden opportunities for revenue and increase customer satisfaction. Best Practices for Upselling: Think like your customer’s roadmap: Understand their priorities and upcoming challenges. State your upsell as a solution, not a sale. Use usage data: Spot patterns in usage. Are they exceeding their limits? Or are you offering them too many features? Data creates a story. Bundle your products: Don’t just add a larger plan, bundle an upgrade with enhanced value, such as priority support or exclusive integrations. Talk in outcomes: Frame the upsell as efficiency, or return on investment, or decreasing risk – something meaningful to the decision makers. Educate the team: Provide account managers with templates to develop a pitch and battle card. A confident team will become a successful team. Keyword Insight: Cross Selling Tips Cross-selling can feel awkward when not executed appropriately. The intention is not to increase sales but to offer your customer more solutions. Actionable Cross Selling Tips: Connect related products to customer pain points: For example, if a customer purchases Product A, consider what the logical connections would be to Product B. Use customer success stories: This is a matter of using case studies that demonstrate significant outcomes when cross-selling additional products. Create “if-you-use-this-then-you-need-that” logic: For example, a customer using cloud backup may also need cybersecurity monitoring. Don’t sell, consult. Your tone should be that of a consultant rather than a sales person. Automate triggers: Set reminders in your CRM system when either an account has significant activity or a customer responds to your outreach eventually cross-selling additional products. Effective Cross-Selling in B2B Sales Trust: Establish your authority and credibility before recommending any changes in the organization. Timing: Timing your message at strategically valuable business moments not solely calendar moments. Tailoring: Customize the message depending on the use case, and industry, and goals aligned together. Keep in mind that B2B still has a long decision cycle, so you have to play the long game .
