generation that lets you create renewal, upsell, and custom account proposals in just a few clicks. It auto-fills key data, supports version tracking, and helps you send polished proposals without switching tools. Do I need to use a CRM if I'm using AMS? Yes, if you’re handling both lead generation and post-sale account growth, using a CRM alongside AMS is ideal. CRM helps you win new clients, while AMS helps you retain, manage, and grow them—together, they cover the full customer lifecycle without overlap. Will this replace my CRM ? No, AMS doesn’t replace your CRM—it complements it. While CRMs focus on capturing leads and closing deals, AMS takes over after the sale by managing client relationships, renewals, and growth. Both tools work best together to cover the full customer journey. Do you charge monthly or annually ? We offer flexible billing options to suit your business needs.
