emotional ties to a brand is related to increased customer loyalty and decreased customer churn. When businesses encourage collaboration between teams, it builds trust and customers are less inclined to change suppliers. Implementing Collaboration to Reduce Churn Collaboration is an important tool, but needs to be guided by purposeful strategy and the right tools to be effective. Below are a few ways companies can utilize collaboration to reduce churn: 1. Invest in Collaboration Tools Using collaboration platforms, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Asana, can promote team members staying connected, and have clearly defined communication.
