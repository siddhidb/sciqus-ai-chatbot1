champions, blockers, and decision-makers — making sure no key stakeholder is missed during QBRs or renewal cycles.

You need an AMS if: You have >20+ paying accounts and can’t track everything in spreadsheets You’re losing deals post-renewal due to poor engagement Your CS team is stuck manually following up with clients You want to scale revenue without increasing headcount Basically:If you’re SaaS, PLG, or service-led — you need AMS.

AMS gives you the full dashboard — so you can fly high, avoid turbulence, and land safely with happy customers. Final Thoughts: Don’t Just Track Accounts. Grow Them.
