& Governance How do we handle user permissions and role-based access during initial setup? Can this be controlled centrally? Sciqus AMS supports centralized role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions by department, hierarchy, and function. What are the risks associated with implementation, and how does your team help mitigate them? Common risks include data migration errors and user resistance. These are mitigated through backup protocols, testing environments, and custom onboarding plans. What security audits or compliance standards does the software adhere to during deployment? Sciqus AMS complies with ISO 27001, GDPR, and undergoes regular security audits to ensure enterprise-grade protection. Post-Go-Live Support & Monitoring After implementation, what is the SLA (Service Level Agreement) for issue resolution or downtime support? We offer SLAs based on your subscription tier, with options including 24/7 support, priority response, and guaranteed resolution windows. Are there built-in monitoring tools or dashboards to track software performance and adoption metrics post-launch? Yes, the platform includes real-time monitoring dashboards for tracking system performance, adoption rates, and usage metrics across departments.
