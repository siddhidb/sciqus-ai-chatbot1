Businesses are moving beyond traditional CRM systems to a more powerful approach: Customer 360. This concept gives you a complete, real-time view of every customer across departments and interactions. If you’re aiming to improve client retention, increase revenue, or drive growth, building a Customer 360 framework is the first step.

Customer 360 means collecting and connecting all customer data—sales, support, product usage, marketing, and billing—into a single, unified profile.
