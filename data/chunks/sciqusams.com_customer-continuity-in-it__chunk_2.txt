won’t be a happy one. Loss of customer continuity isn’t just a flaw in process—it’s a gap in customer respect. When teams don’t preserve and share information, it sends a message: “We weren’t paying attention.” That message is costly. To fix it, IT organizations must prioritize internal knowledge retention with the same urgency as client acquisition. The solution lies not only in training or process updates, but in embedding systems that remember. Because when your organization remembers your clients, your clients remember you—in the best possible way.
