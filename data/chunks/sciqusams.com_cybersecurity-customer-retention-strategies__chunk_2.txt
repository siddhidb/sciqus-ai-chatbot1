to cybersecurity on behalf of their vendors saw a 40% reduction in client churn. 6. Building Social Proof & Referrals Cybersecurity companies that display authentic testimonials, client case studies, and third party reviews build a circle of trust that retains existing customers and attracts new customers.Encourage well-placed, established customers to share their experiences with your products or vendors; use incentives to generate multimedia success stories that will appeal to or influence potential customers. Peer influence is still one of the most trusted marketing forms. Conclusion: Trust is the Prime Retention Weapon While technology may stop breaches in the field of cybersecurity, it is trust that stops the churn. Technologies are constantly changing and evolving into new threats, so clients prefer to work with companies that they can trust through the good and bad times. We here at Sciqusams.com are firm believers that those essential connections can be made when a company can consistently perform, communicate openly, and treat you as a person instead of a number or a lead. As competition increases, and new, complicated cyber risks emerge, cybersecurity companies will need to work even harder to develop trust with customers. Because in the end, trust isn’t just earned, it’s retained.
