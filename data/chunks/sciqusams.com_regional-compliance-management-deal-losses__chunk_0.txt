How Regional Compliance Management Challenges Lead to Lost B2B Deals - The AI-Powered Account Management Solution Get In Touch Get In Touch Edit Template How Regional Compliance Management Challenges Lead to Lost B2B Deals In the B2B arena today, simply having an awesome product or service is not sufficient regardless of how great your solution may be, it needs to align with the complexity of regional compliance, regulation, standards, and requirements to win new deals. Sales teams/account managers regularly lose valuable deals that can impact their company, simply due to their inability to navigate the landscape of regional compliance management and proposal complexities. This is an increasingly prevalent issue. In a report published by Forrester in 2023, they recounted how 47% of B2B organizations reported loss of at least one big deal due to regional compliance or unaligned proposal processes.
