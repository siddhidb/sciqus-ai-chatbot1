How Poor Cross-Functional Collaboration in IT Undermines Client Success - The AI-Powered Account Management Solution Get In Touch Get In Touch Edit Template How Poor Cross-Functional Collaboration in IT Undermines Client Success When we talk about Information Technology, innovation, speed, and client success are the buzzwords of the day. Why such a perturbingly big reference to the so-called “distant internal factors”? From a developing point of view, software development and cybersecurity, IT services, and AI all require fundamental teamwork considerations. Right from the first meeting with a client or during the active delivery of a project, everything relies on accurate communication and proper sharing between teams. However, the stark truth is that many IT firms have an internal collaboration problem. Different departments work on different tools and processes, and sometimes there is no established mechanism to put out important information. Not that they didn’t want to have collaboration, but the support systems were simply not there. And that’s where clients feel it: the impact of silo teams on their projects. According to the 2023 report by management consultant firm McKinsey, about 75% of the IT professionals surveyed blamed interdepartmental collaboration for project delays-the bigger our number, the bigger our malady. Understanding the Roots of Disconnection Let us now trace the routes taken by collaboration to disappear in IT companies: Disconnected Platforms: One team is using a CRM tool; another one works with a project tracker; none of them are talking to each other. Lack of Unified Client View: Nobody sees the full view of the client; everyone knows only their share. Informal Knowledge Handoffs: Much of the vital information is passed through email threads or informal chats, with hardly any formal record kept. Diverging Priorities: Sales teams just want to close deals while, on the other hand, Delivery teams want to make sure the job is actually doable. Thus arises the friction. It is not that teams are unskilled or demotivated; they simply lack the naturally shared space in which they can collaborate painlessly. Gap-filling tools such as AI-backed collaborative tools, customer engagement platforms, and self-service portals for enterprises can usher in some connectivity among the teams. These tools help narrow down on cross-functional collaboration if one believes in its notion. Account management handover challenges frequently originate here, particularly when knowledge transfer lacks structure. When one department’s process ends without syncing with the next, accountability and client context are lost
