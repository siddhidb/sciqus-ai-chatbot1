Why Retention Matters
Customer retention boosts revenue, strengthens loyalty, and reduces acquisition costs, ensuring sustainable business growth.
 
 
 Customer Loyalty Drives Revenue
68% of customers leave simply because they don’t feel valued. Strengthening engagement prevents unnecessary churn.
 
 
 
 Your Existing Customers Are Your Biggest Asset
 80% of future profits will come from just 20% of your current customers. Retention fuels long-term business growth.
 
 
 
 Acquisition Costs More Than Retention
 It costs 5X more to acquire a new customer than to keep an existing one. Prioritizing retention saves money and maximizes profitability.
 
 
 
 Engagement is Key
50% of customer churn happens due to a lack of follow-ups and engagement. Consistent communication builds lasting relationships.
