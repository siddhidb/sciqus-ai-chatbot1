Best SaaS Retention Metrics in 2025: 
Proven KPIs to Cut Churn & Grow LTV
 
Why SaaS Retention Metrics Matter in 2025
In 2025, SaaS businesses are under immense pressure to retain customers, not just acquire them. With customer acquisition costs (CAC) rising and budgets tightening, the focus has shifted to net revenue retention (NRR) and customer lifetime value (CLTV).
Top SaaS companies no longer wait for churn—they predict and prevent it using data-driven metrics.
If you’re not tracking the right SaaS retention KPIs, you’re flying blind.
Top SaaS Retention Metrics Every Business Must Track in 2025
These are the most actionable retention metrics SaaS leaders rely on today.
1. Customer Retention Rate (CRR)
What It Is:
 The percentage of customers you keep over a period.
Formula:
CRR = [(Customers at end – New customers) / Customers at start] × 100
2025 Benchmark:
 90%+ annually for mature B2B SaaS
Why It Matters:
 It shows your overall account health and relationship stickiness.
2. Customer Churn Rate
What It Is:
 The percentage of customers lost.
Formula:
Churn = (Customers lost ÷ Total customers at start) × 100
2025 Benchmark:
Enterprise SaaS: < 7%
SMB SaaS: 10–20%
Insight:
 High churn indicates product-market misfit, poor onboarding, or missing value realization.
3. Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
Formula:
NRR = (Recurring revenue + expansions – downgrades – churn) ÷ Recurring revenue × 100
Benchmark for 2025:
 115%+
Why It Works:
 NRR is the holy grail—it captures upsell momentum and churn impact in one KPI.
4. Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)
Formula:
GRR = (Revenue – churn – downgrades) ÷ Starting revenue × 100
Benchmark:
 85–95%
Insight:
 GRR helps isolate retention, without expansion masking churn.
5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
Formula:
CLTV = (ARPU × gross margin) ÷ churn rate
Benchmark:
 CLTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 or higher
Why It’s Strategic:
 Helps you balance acquisition costs against real customer value.
6. Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)
DAU/MAU Ratio Benchmark:
 20–30%
Track frequency of user logins, actions taken, feature adoption. It predicts early disengagement before churn occurs.
7.  Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) & Net Promoter Score (NPS)
CSAT Benchmark:
 85–90%
NPS Benchmark (B2B SaaS):
 30–50
These metrics aren’t standalone but offer qualitative churn warning signals.
