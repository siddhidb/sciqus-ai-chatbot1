Can AMS replace CRM?
No. AMS complements CRM. CRM handles pre-sale activities (leads, opportunities), while AMS manages post-sale lifecycle (account growth, stakeholder engagement, retention strategy).
 
 
 
 
 
Who typically uses AMS vs CRM?
CRM is used by sales and marketing teams to convert leads. AMS is used by account managers, customer success teams, and delivery leaders to build long-term client relationships.

How is your product different from ‘Salesforce’?
Salesforce is primarily a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool designed to manage sales pipelines, leads, and customer acquisition. While it’s highly configurable, it often requires extensive setup, technical expertise, and custom development to meet post-sale account management needs.
In contrast, our platform is built specifically for Account Management, focusing on what happens after the sale is closed. It offers:
Out-of-the-box tools for renewals, churn tracking, and upsell opportunities
Built-in stakeholder mapping and meeting logs to manage client engagement
Customizable QBR (Quarterly Business Review) dashboards

Do I need to use a CRM if I'm using AMS?
Yes, if you’re handling both lead generation and post-sale account growth, using a CRM alongside AMS is ideal. CRM helps you win new clients, while AMS helps you retain, manage, and grow them—together, they cover the full customer lifecycle without overlap.
 
 
 
 
 
Will this replace my CRM ?
No, AMS doesn’t replace your CRM—it complements it. While CRMs focus on capturing leads and closing deals, AMS takes over after the sale by managing client relationships, renewals, and growth. Both tools work best together to cover the full customer journey.
