How Effective Renewals Reduce Churn & Boost Customer Retention | Proven Strategies
 
Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who terminate their relationship with a business. Churn is a major issue for companies spanning across any and every industry. The simplest remedy to Customer churn is to focus on customer renewal. When a renewal process is done correctly, it will create predictable cash flow and lead to a better relationship with your customers ultimately resulting in a decrease in customer churn. 
Understanding the Role of Renewals in Reducing ChurnRenewals offer rich learning moments in the customer lifecycle, allowing teams to reaffirm value received and address any issues. A structurally fluid renewal process has the potential to reduce churn in a variety of ways, such as:​
Reliable Revenue Stream
: Regular renewals provide predictable income, thus supporting businesses with financial stability to plan for growth and resource allocation. This dependable revenue stream can be reinvested into the product or service, which ultimately increases customer retention or satisfaction rates. ​
Proactive Customer Engagement:
 If you engage with a customer prior to their renewal they will perceive you as being invested in their success. Offering personalized outreach to your customers about renewal gives them the unique opportunity to address implicit needs and reiterate value in their contract, which will help make the customer feel important and known.
Opportunity for Feedback and Improvement:
 The moment a contract begins to close out is an optimal time to ask for a customer to provide feedback. Franchisees often encounter challenges related to execution. Taking time to understand the franchisee’s experience through the contract period and reflect on what challenges occurred, offers opportunities for immediate improvement and demonstrates to those franchisees that you care about making things better. The history of the customer experience leads to valuable opportunities for improvement that would not normally come to light without renewal conversations, and demonstrates an ongoing commitment to improvement.
Opportunity for Upselling or Cross-Selling:
 A renewal opportunity is just that, an opportunity. Opportunities to introduce additional products or services aligning with an evolving need for that customer is how upsells occur. Given that a customer is renewing, this not only represents another stream of reliable revenue, it reinforces that product or service value alignment, and ultimately creates more reliance on your business products and services.
Proven Renewal Strategies to Reduce Churn & Improve Customer Retention
 
Communicate Early and Openly:
 Open renewal conversations with customers long before the end of the contract date. Effective communication practices, early, and open, will prevent all surprises later and give customers time to think about their options. 
Personalized Renewal Offers:
 Offer renewal proposals based on their usage and objectives. Customized offers, based on a deep understanding of the customer’s situation, will show you are looking out for their best interests and will positively impact renewal.
Flexible Payment Options: 
Flexible payment plans, such as Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), can allow for improved budgets and take the complication out of renewal. This can have particular merits in small and medium enterprises dependent on cash flow variability. 
Support Customers to Onboard You product or service:
 Ensure customers feel supported and informed about your product or service from the beginning. As additional support and training are offered throughout the customer experience, the better your customer will feel about their investment and the more likely a renewal will come.   
Inform and Evaluate Using Predictive Analytics:
 Use data to justify any renewal offer and identify customers with the highest churn probability (or may not). Predictive analytics will look at a customer’s behavior to identify patterns, and to allow you to address concerns before a renewal period.
Conclusion
 
focusing on customer renewals is a great way to cut down on attrition. By creating personalized and proactive approaches to renewal, businesses can build long-term relationships, create predictable revenue, and allow for growth opportunities. Strong execution of these approaches promotes retention, and secures a business’s
