How AI-Powered Team Collaboration Tools Fix Communication Breakdowns
 
 
 
The Communication Breakdown That Costs More Than Time
 
Internal communication breakdowns within an organization’s departments are costly, but it is important to look at communication breakdowns in a global context, as it can have an impact on the entire organization. As noted earlier, internal communication breakdowns can be quite costly, especially from a productivity perspective. 
According to a report from 
The Economist Intelligence Unit, 44% of employees cite
 miscommunication as the number one reason projects are delayed. According to a Holmes report, 
poor internal communication costs businesses an average of $12,506 per employee, annually.
 Then consider that for a larger, mid-sized company, that lost productivity grows quickly into staggering numbers.
At Sciqusams.com, we specialize in helping organizations with this issue, by enabling them to 
foster collaboration and improve communication 
which results in reduced delays for internal projects and leads to overall customer satisfaction.
Identifying the Root Causes
Before addressing solutions, let’s unpack the underlying reason for the chaos:
Cause of Miscommunication
 
Cause of Miscommunication
 
Impact
 
 
 Siloed tools and platforms 
 
 
 
 Teams that are using different tools lack the context and visibility into what is happening 
 
 
 
 Missing centralized knowledge 
 
 
 
 Valuable information is lost in an email or chat thread 
 
 
 
 Inconsistent workflows 
 
 
 
 Each team has their own way of doing things, leading to confusion 
 
 
 
 Remote/hybrid environments 
 
 
 
 Geographic distance increases disconnects 
 
 
 
 No single source of truth 
 
 
 
 Updates, tasks, and priorities are spread across multiple tools and locations 
 
Real-World Impact: How Communication Gaps Hurt Business

Project Deliverables Gaps

3. Lost Revenue Opportunities
Poor collaboration equals loss of upselling, cross-selling and renewals.
4. Lack of Morale
Teams feel disconnected and undervalued when their voice is lost in the noise.
