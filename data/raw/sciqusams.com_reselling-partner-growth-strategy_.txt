How Reseller Partnerships Drive Growth: Boost Retention, Upselling & Cross-Selling with Ease
 
 
 
In the rapidly changing digital marketplace, brands are always searching for fresh strategies to improve customer retention and increase revenue. An effective way to support these objectives is through product reselling partnerships. When the focus is on upselling, cross-selling and retention of customers, businesses can not only strengthen their current customer base but also drive continued growth.
Understanding the Product Reselling Partner Model
A product reselling partner is an intermediary who sells your company’s products or services for you and under an agreed upon arrangement. This partnership model is ideal for businesses to reach into new markets and territories at a fraction of the cost of the sales overhead associated with direct sell into markets. Resellers can be a value-added partner who provides a complementary service or can be just a standalone even on a contractual basis to the distributor for the purpose of product placement.
The Power of Retention in Reselling Partnerships
It is considerably less expensive to retain an existing customer than it is to acquire a new customer. Research has shown that a
 5% customer retention can increase profits by 25% to 95%.
 Reselling partners play an important role in retaining customers because of their delivery of ongoing support, tailored recommendations, and special loyalty programs specific to the needs of existing customers. 
Retention strategies can include:
Customer Loyalty Programs:
 Rewarding customers for making repeat purchases through discounts and specials. 
Personalized Communication
: Using CRM tools to stay in touch with customer activity in order to connect on their needs and wants. 
Support First:
 Promptly answering customer inquiries and requests establishes thickness and trust with your customer. 
Upselling: Enhancing Customer Value
 
 
 
Upselling is getting the customer to buy an upgraded version of the product or an addition of premium features. According to HubSpot, 
“72% of all salespeople who upsell/back-sell, experience bigger growth.” 
A reselling partner can tap into their data, the customer knowledge, and present an upgrade that would add value while enhancing the user experience. 
Common upselling methods include:
Cross-selling is characterized by suggesting related products or services that could add value to the purchase made by the customer. Companies such as Amazon report that cross-sell strategies, like “frequently bought together” suggestions account for 35% of their revenue. 
Cross-Selling Strategies for Resellers:
Solution Selling: 
You can cross-sell additional products that solve related pain points. 
Subscription:
 Introduce bundles of services as a way to engage customers long-term. 
Time-Limited Offers:
 Encourage the customer to take action on a time-limited offer connected with a related item.
