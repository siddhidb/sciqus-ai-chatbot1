Customer Loyalty Through Customer Engagement
 
In the modern Account Management ecosystem, Marketing plays a pivotal role in nurturing customer relationships beyond the initial sale. At SciqusAMS, we believe that customer loyalty is built through consistent engagement, meaningful communication, and shared success.
Our marketing framework strengthens every stage of the customer journey — transforming customers into long-term advocates.
Marketing’s Role in Account Management
1. Customer Feedback and Insights
Regular Customer Surveys and Net Promoter Score (NPS) assessments provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction and engagement levels. These insights help Account Managers proactively address challenges and identify new opportunities for growth.
 
2. Success Story Development
 
Marketing leads the Customer Success Story process — from identifying impactful outcomes to guiding customers through a well-structured content approval workflow.
 
 
Draft success story using a predefined template.
 
 
Seek customer permission and coordinate approvals.
 
 
Where direct content sharing isn’t possible, initiate internal content creation and secure customer validation.
Each story becomes a shared success — showcasing customer value and brand partnership.

3. Event Engagement
Customers are regularly invited to online webinars, product showcases, or industry events. Marketing also collaborates with Account Managers to feature customers as speakers or panelists, reinforcing their expertise and partnership visibility.
4. Customer Testimonials
Through personalized guidance, marketing facilitates customer testimonials in both written and video formats. Similar to the success story process, each testimonial is managed carefully — from invitation to script assistance to customer approval.
5. Brand Engagement and Communication
Marketing ensures that customers stay connected with the company’s journey — sharing key milestones, achievements, and innovation updates that reinforce confidence in SciqusAMS’s brand and long-term commitment.
