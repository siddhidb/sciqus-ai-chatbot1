Turning Afterthoughts Into Opportunities: Mastering Upselling and Cross-Selling in B2B
 
 
 
Upselling and cross-selling are usually pushed down to the bottom of the priority list in B2B sales environments with high stakes on the line. Most account managers tend to be hyper-focused on getting new accounts onboarded and resolving fire drills of existing accounts. The problem is ignoring how to grow and manage existing relationships through upselling and cross-selling is a silent killer of revenue.
The fact is that it costs six to seven times more to acquire a new customer than to retain and grow an existing customer relationship. Even with that logic established, there are still lots of companies that think about upselling and cross-selling afterwards in the sales process.
In this blog, we will walk through why this is a bad idea and how simply following upselling best-practice strategies for account managers will result in the potential for big growth. We will also share actionable tips on cross selling in B2B sales in addition to an overview of effective cross selling as it relates to B2B sales.

The Real Problem: A Reactive vs. Proactive Mindset
Most businesses are reactive. Account managers wait until the renewal time, or when the customer raises a need. By that time, it is often too late. Your competitors may already be pitching better options.
The truth is, upselling and cross-selling should be a part of the corporate account management system – not by accident.
The Right Time to Upsell and Cross-Sell? It's Sooner Than You Think
Timing is everything! But waiting for the “perfect moment” often leads to no moment.This is a simple flowchart to see when to bring up upselling or cross-selling:
 
 
 
Pro tip: The best time to upsell is after initial success but before contract renewal.
Best Practices for Upselling for Account Managers
Account managers are more than just support; they are drivers of growth. They should utilize these best practices when upselling to find the hidden opportunities for revenue and increase customer satisfaction.
Best Practices for Upselling:
Think like your customer’s roadmap:
 Understand their priorities and upcoming challenges. State your upsell as a solution, not a sale.
Use usage data: 
Spot patterns in usage. Are they exceeding their limits? Or are you offering them too many features? Data creates a story.
Bundle your products:
 Don’t just add a larger plan, bundle an upgrade with enhanced value, such as priority support or exclusive integrations.
Talk in outcomes:
 Frame the upsell as efficiency, or return on investment, or decreasing risk – something meaningful to the decision makers.
Educate the team:
 Provide account managers with templates to develop a pitch and battle card. A confident team will become a successful team.
Keyword Insight: Cross Selling Tips
Cross-selling can feel awkward when not executed appropriately. The intention is not to increase sales but to offer your customer more solutions.
Actionable Cross Selling Tips:
Connect related products to customer pain points:
 For example, if a customer purchases Product A, consider what the logical connections would be to Product B.
Use customer success stories:
 This is a matter of using case studies that demonstrate significant outcomes when cross-selling additional products. 
Create “if-you-use-this-then-you-need-that” logic:
 For example, a customer using cloud backup may also need cybersecurity monitoring. 
Don’t sell, consult. 
Your tone should be that of a consultant rather than a sales person. 
Automate triggers: 
Set reminders in your CRM system when either an account has significant activity or a customer responds to your outreach eventually cross-selling additional products. 
Effective Cross-Selling in B2B Sales
 
 
 
Trust: 
Establish your authority and credibility before recommending any changes in the organization.
Timing: 
Timing your message at strategically valuable business moments not solely calendar moments.
Tailoring: 
Customize the message depending on the use case, and industry, and goals aligned together.
Keep in mind that B2B still has a long decision cycle, so you have to play the long game

Common Mistakes to Avoid
Even with good intentions, many teams can fall into these traps:
🚫 Adding unrelated extras just to check a box
🚫 Trying to sell too soon in the relationship
🚫 Not following up after the sale
🚫 Not paying attention to account usage data
🚫 Not aligning with the customer’s business goals
Avoiding these pitfalls is just as important as following best practices.
Example from the Real World
One of the top SaaS companies in the world put AI-driven insights on account usage in place, they were able to see that
 40%
 of their customers were under utilizing a core functionality that was only available in the higher price tiers. Then they were able, through personalized proactive conversations that demonstrated use-case, to 
upsell 25% 
of those accounts in the first quarter, resulting in a 
17% increase in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)!
Conclusion: Trust is the Prime Retention Weapon
Used properly, 
upselling and cross-selling
 won’t feel like tactics — they will be valuable, timely conversations. Businesses who put the proper training, tools, and data in place for account managers will make faster strides in their accounts than businesses who’ve made
 account expansion an afterthought.
 
✅Add the upselling best practices for account managers to your sales playbook. 
✅Structure your targeted cross selling tips to create a compelling story for your customers. 
✅If you’re not already doing so, consider effective cross-selling in B2B sales as one of your growth pillars, not shortcuts to sales.
