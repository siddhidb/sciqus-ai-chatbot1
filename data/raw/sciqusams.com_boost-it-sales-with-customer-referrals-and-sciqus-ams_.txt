Boost IT Sales With Customer Referrals And Sciqus AMS
 
Acquiring new customers in today’s competitive IT sector is both costly and time-consuming. Conventional methods of customer acquisition, including cold calls, online advertising, and paid advertising, tend to be cost-intensive with doubtful returns. But amongst the best yet least used tactics for IT firms is customer referrals.
The Value of Customer Referrals in IT Sales
 
Referral customers are the strongest method to generate business expansion. Referral customers have been found to convert at a higher rate, earn more revenue, and be more loyal than those brought in via other means. Referral prospects, in particular:
Realize 25% higher profit margins than other means of customer acquisition.
Are 18% more loyal, with longer-term business relationships.
Are 4X more likely to refer other customers, resulting in a perpetual cycle of expansion.
In spite of such evident benefits, most IT firms are not able to set up an effective referral process. Account Managers fail to have tools for tracking and managing referrals in a systematic way, which results in lost opportunities and revenues. That is where Sciqus AMS enters.
Welcome to Sciqus AMS Referral Feature
 
Sciqus AMS is used to assist IT Account Managers in maximizing customer referral potential by offering an easy-to-use and productive way of handling referrals. Its strong referral feature guarantees that all prospects are tracked, qualified, and turned into a closed sale. By capitalizing on customer relationships in an organized manner, companies can get a continuous flow of high-quality referrals.

The Competitive Edge of a Robust Referral System
For technology firms, a successful referral program is more than a sales tactic—it’s a competitive advantage. A well-executed referral program can lead to: Reduced customer acquisition costs: Because referrals are coming from current customers, businesses can cut back on spending on conventional marketing and sales activities. Quicker deal closure: Referral leads already have some degree of trust in your company, which reduces the sales cycle. Deeper customer relationships: Referral encouragement helps to build loyalty and a sense of community between current customers.
