Salesforce is primarily a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool designed to manage sales pipelines, leads, and customer acquisition. While it’s highly configurable, it often requires extensive setup, technical expertise, and custom development to meet post-sale account management needs.
In contrast, our platform is built specifically for Account Management, focusing on what happens after the sale is closed. It offers:

Built-in stakeholder mapping and meeting logs to manage client engagement
Customizable QBR (Quarterly Business Review) dashboards

 Yes, if you’re handling both lead generation and post-sale account growth, using a CRM alongside AMS is ideal. CRM helps you win new clients, while AMS helps you retain, manage, and grow them—together, they cover the full customer lifecycle without overlap.
